# Big Integer Arithmetic Library (C++)

## 📌 Overview
C++ built-in data types such as `int` and `long long` have fixed size limits and cannot handle very large numbers.  
This project implements a **custom Big Integer (BigInt) class** that supports **arbitrary precision arithmetic** using strings.

The project is inspired by the **GeeksforGeeks Big Integer concept** and extended into a complete, object-oriented C++ application.
